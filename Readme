The timer on the left counts up till the event.
The timer on the right counts down till 0.
The input box gets disabled when either of the start buttons are clicked and gets enabled when either reset button is clicked so that
the user cannot change the input midway between an operation.
The start/pause buttons get disabled when the timers finish their counting.
